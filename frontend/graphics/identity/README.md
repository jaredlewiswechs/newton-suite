# Newton Identity Graphics

Warm. Human. Elegant.

## Design Philosophy

These graphics are inspired by:

- **National Parks** — Warm, welcoming signage that says "you belong here"
- **Grand Central Station** — The celestial ceiling, timeless elegance, a sense of place
- **Apple** — Clean, minimal, designed for humans by humans

This is not a science lab. This is a home.

*"You didn't design Newton. You remembered it."*
