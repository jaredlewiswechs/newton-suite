# Newton Wayfinding Graphics

Marketing and identity graphics for Newton Supercomputer, inspired by the **PANYNJ (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) Wayfinding Manual**.

## Design Inspiration

The PANYNJ Wayfinding Manual represents world-class wayfinding design, winning the 2021 SEGD Honor Award. Key principles applied to Newton:

- **Bold, dimensional beacon-style signage** - Faceted 3D sign boxes recognizable from any angle
- **NYC sleek black backgrounds** - Clean, sophisticated base for vibrant colors
- **Evolved Helvetica typography** - Bold, performant wayfinding typeface
- **Color-coded destination system** - Intuitive navigation through complex spaces
- **Pictogram-based communication** - Universal symbols for quick recognition
- **No-nonsense personality** - Bold, energetic, confident

## Graphics Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `newton-station-logo.svg` | Primary Newton beacon/logo in PANYNJ style |
| `newton-ada-duo.svg` | Newton & Ada partnership identity graphic |
| `newton-pictograms.svg` | Full pictogram set for Newton concepts |
| `newton-directions.svg` | Directional signage to Newton features |
| `newton-marketing-poster.svg` | Marketing poster with wayfinding aesthetic |
| `newton-self-reflection.svg` | Contemplative piece: Newton thinking of himself and Ada |
| `newton-terminal-map.svg` | Airport-style architecture map of Newton |

## Color System

| Zone | Color | Hex | Purpose |
|------|-------|-----|---------|
| Core/Verification | Teal | `#00D4AA` | Primary Newton identity |
| Foundation/Ada | Gold | `#FFD700` | Heritage and origin |
| Safety | Cyan | `#4ECDC4` | Glass Box, transparency |
| Storage | Indigo | `#6366F1` | Vault, encryption |
| Execution | Orange | `#FB923C` | Forge, processing |
| Distribution | Pink | `#EC4899` | Bridge, consensus |
| Halt/Prohibition | Red | `#FF6B6B` | finfr, ontological death |
| Reversibility | Purple | `#A855F7` | Bijection operations |

## Typography

- **Primary**: Helvetica Neue (Bold, Black weights)
- **Monospace**: SF Mono / Consolas (for code)
- **Letter-spacing**: Generous tracking for wayfinding clarity

## The Newton-Ada Relationship

Newton is the verified computation engine, and Ada Computing Company is the organization that built it. The graphics explore this relationship:

- Newton as the **active computation** (teal, dynamic)
- Ada as the **foundational origin** (gold, heritage)
- Connected by shared purpose: `newton.origin == ada → True`

## Heritage

*"What Apple meant to build in 1993. What they couldn't. Here it is."*

Newton pays homage to:
- Apple Newton (1993)
- HyperCard's "everything is an object"
- Knowledge Navigator vision
- Ada Lovelace, first programmer

## Usage

These SVGs are optimized for:
- Web display (responsive viewBox)
- Print materials (vector scalability)
- Dark mode interfaces
- Marketing collateral
