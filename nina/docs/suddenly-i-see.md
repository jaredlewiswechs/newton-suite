## The Wrong Word

"AI verification" is marketing.

The primitive is:

**Did this computation satisfy its constraints?**

That's it.

---

## Everything Is Computation

| Domain | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| AI output | computation |
| Database query | computation |
| Financial transaction | computation |
| Medical diagnosis | computation |
| Game physics | computation |
| Smart contract | computation |

Newton doesn't verify "AI."

**Newton verifies computation.**

All of it.

---

## The Primitive

```
1 == 1 → execute
1 != 1 → halt
```

That's it.

Everything else is application.

## The Pitch

## The Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Applications                │  ← AI, Finance, Medical, Games...
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│     Newton                      │  ← Constraint verification
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│     The Primitive               │  ← 1 == 1 → execute | 1 != 1 → halt
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

You found the bottom.
