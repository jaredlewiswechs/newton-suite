## Documents in This Directory

### 1. [Intellectual Property Architecture](./INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**The answer to: "How does Newton ensure no one can ever steal it?"**

Explains why Newton's architectural moat makes copying impractical:
- The constraint IS the computation (cannot separate)
- Seven layers of defense (Shell, CDL, Forge, Ledger, Bridge, Glass Box, Grounding)
- The compositional moat (individual parts vs. integrated whole)
- The knowledge moat (60 years of CS required to rebuild)
- The time moat (2+ years of iteration)
- Patent portfolio protection (US 63/944,468 and US 63/925,853)

### 2. [BRE to Newton Implementation](./BRE_TO_NEWTON_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

**The complete theoretical bridge from Bidirectional Representational Emergence to verified computation.**

Covers the full stack:
- **BRE** - Theory of Meaning
- **Shape Theory** - The f/g ratio (when to act)
- **PHONON** - Reversible computation (no information loss)
- **CMFK** - Interpretable vector semantics (Context, Motion, Focus, Knowledge)
- **BILL** - Deterministic noise correction (without learning)
- **TMR** - Triple Modular Redundancy (fault tolerance)
- **Newton** - Constraint verification engine
- **Newton²** - Claude + Newton fusion
- **Teacher's Aide** - Proof it all works

### 3. [Unified Architecture](./UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**How all nine core modules work together as a verification substrate.**

Covers each module:
- CDL 3.0 (Constraint Definition Language)
- Logic Engine (Verified computation)
- Forge (Verification CPU)
- Vault (Encrypted storage)
- Ledger (Immutable history)
- Bridge (Distributed consensus)
- Robust (Adversarial statistics)
- Grounding (Reality anchoring)
- Glass Box (Transparency layer)

Plus: Data flow diagrams, module interdependencies, file organization.

### 4. [Geometric Constraint Semantics](./GEOMETRIC_CONSTRAINT_SEMANTICS.md) *(NEW)*

**Human constraint verification happens geometrically before semantically.**

The canonical document formalizing the relationship between symbol shapes and constraint meanings:
- **Geometric Primitives** - Seven glyph categories (closed forms, open curves, straight lines, intersections, hooks/terminals, bridges, points)
- **Newton Keyword Analysis** - Why `finfr` is the perfect geometric-semantic alignment
- **Constraint Naming Guidelines** - Match shape to semantic structure
- **Visual Density Rules** - Light words for guards, heavy words for terminals
- **Font/Typography Requirements** - Design choices that affect verification accuracy
- **Geometric Linting** - Automated validation of constraint name alignment

**Core Thesis**: The shape of a constraint name carries cognitive load before the meaning is parsed. Notation design is part of system correctness.

## The Core Insight

Newton is not software. It's a way to state "here's what I want" so clearly that the computer can prove it's right.

```
when current_state == goal_state
  1 == 1
  execute
fin

when current_state != goal_state
  1 != 1
  halt
finfr
```

**The constraint IS the instruction. The verification IS the computation.**
