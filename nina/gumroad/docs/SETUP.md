## Choosing Which Constraints to Use

Newton includes three constraint categories:

| Category | Detects | Use When |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Medical** | Drug advice, diagnoses, treatment claims | Verifying health information |
| **Legal** | Legal advice, jurisdiction claims, rights statements | Verifying legal information |
| **Epistemic** | Logical fallacies, contradictions, missing sources | Verifying any factual claims |

**Default**: All three are enabled. This provides maximum protection.

**To customize** which constraints run:
1. Open **Shortcuts app**
2. Find **Newton** shortcut
3. Tap the **⋯** button (three dots)
4. Tap **Edit**
5. Find the "constraints" array in the API call
6. Remove constraint names you don't want to check

Example: To only check medical claims:
```json
"constraints": ["medical"]
```

**More details**: See `CUSTOMIZATION.md`

## What Newton Does

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. You share text to Newton                    │
│     ↓                                            │
│  2. Newton sends to verification API            │
│     ↓                                            │
│  3. API checks against active constraints       │
│     ↓                                            │
│  4. Result returned in <1 second                │
│     ↓                                            │
│  5a. ✅ VERIFIED → Show content                 │
│  5b. ❌ BLOCKED → Show violations               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Fast**: Verification completes in under 1 second  
**Deterministic**: Same input always gives same result  
**Private**: Only the text you share is sent to API

## Common Setup Questions

### "I can't find the Shortcuts app"
- It's built into iOS 17+
- Look for blue icon with white squares
- If deleted, re-download from App Store (free)

### "The shortcut won't install"
1. Check iOS version (Settings → General → About)
2. Make sure iOS 17+ is installed
3. Enable "Allow Untrusted Shortcuts" (see Step 2)

### "Newton doesn't appear in Share Sheet"
1. Make sure shortcut is installed (open Shortcuts app)
2. Try restarting your device
3. Some apps don't support Share Sheet - try Notes first

### "Verification is slow"
- Check internet connection
- API is hosted on free tier - may have cold start (~2-3 seconds first time)
- Subsequent verifications are fast (<1 second)

### "Every check says BLOCKED"
- This might be correct! Try verifying safe content first
- Check constraint configuration (see CUSTOMIZATION.md)
- Verify API endpoint is reachable

**More troubleshooting**: See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
