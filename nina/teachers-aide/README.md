# Newton Teacher's Aide

## The Ultimate Teaching Assistant for HISD's New Education System

**finfr = f/g** — Every constraint is a ratio between what you're trying to do (f) and what reality allows (g).

Newton Teacher's Aide is a Newton Supercomputer-powered web application that transforms how teachers plan, assess, and collaborate. Built with tinyTalk constraint-based verification, it treats TEKS standards and NES requirements as machine-readable objects for guaranteed compliance.

**Version**: 1.3.0 | **Date**: January 4, 2026 | **Jared Nashon Lewis** | **Jared Lewis Conglomerate** | **parcRI** | **Newton** | **tinyTalk** | **Ada Computing Company**

**"1 == 1. The constraint IS the instruction. finfr = f/g."**

### The AI Bubble Context (2025-2026)

Newton was crystallized at a specific moment in history:

```
2025 AI Investment:     $202.3 billion (+75% YoY)
2026 Hyperscaler CapEx: $602 billion (+36% YoY)
New Tech Debt (2025):   $121 billion (4x historical average)
Projected Borrowing:    $1.5 trillion (Morgan Stanley/JPMorgan)

The industry is spending $602 billion on probabilistic AI.
Newton provides deterministic verification for compute cycles.

## f/g Ratio Constraints in Education

Newton's **finfr = f/g** dimensional analysis applies to education:

| Constraint | f | g | Threshold | Description |
|------------|---|---|-----------|-------------|
| **Class Size** | students | capacity | ≤ 1.0 | No overcrowding |
| **Workload** | assigned_tasks | available_time | ≤ 1.0 | Reasonable workload |
| **Mastery Rate** | mastered_students | total_students | ≥ 0.8 | 80% mastery target |
| **Intervention** | struggling_students | teacher_capacity | ≤ 1.0 | Manageable intervention groups |

### Example: Class Size Constraint

```python
from newton_sdk import Blueprint, field, law, forge, when, finfr, ratio

class Classroom(Blueprint):
    students = field(int, default=0)
    capacity = field(int, default=25)

    @law
    def no_overcrowding(self):
        # Students cannot exceed capacity
        when(ratio(self.students, self.capacity) > 1.0, finfr)

    @forge
    def enroll(self, count: int):
        self.students += count

room = Classroom()
room.enroll(20)   # ✓ Works (ratio = 0.8)
room.enroll(10)   # ✗ BLOCKED (ratio would be 1.2 > 1.0)
```

## Best Practices

### For Teachers
1. **Be specific with TEKS codes** - Enter exact codes for better alignment
2. **Use the topic field** - A specific topic improves lesson focus
3. **Include accommodations** - List students needing ELL, 504, SPED, or GT support
4. **Analyze exit tickets immediately** - Use the Assessment Analyzer right after class
5. **Generate PLC reports weekly** - Keep your team informed with regular data updates
6. **Enter scores by name** - Use `/quick-scores` for fast entry without IDs
7. **Check groups daily** - Use `/groups` endpoint to see updated differentiation tiers

### For Administrators
1. **Review mastery rates** - Track progress toward campus goals
2. **Monitor reteach groups** - Identify students needing intervention
3. **Use PLC reports for walkthrough planning** - See what instruction looks like
4. **Compare TEKS coverage** - Ensure all standards are addressed
5. **Export data regularly** - Use `/teachers/db/save` for backup

## tinyTalk Education Laws

The education module is built with tinyTalk constraint laws:

```python
class NESLessonPlan(Blueprint):
    @law
    def duration_law(self):
        """Total lesson duration must be 50 minutes."""
        when(self.total_duration != 50, finfr)

    @law
    def teks_alignment_law(self):
        """Lesson must align to at least one TEKS standard."""
        when(len(self.teks_codes) == 0, finfr)

    @law
    def phase_completeness_law(self):
        """Lesson must include all 5 NES phases."""
        when(phase_types != required, finfr)
```
