## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: I'm a student working on a startup idea. Do I need a commercial license?

**A:** While you're learning and building prototypes with no revenue, the free license applies. Once you start generating revenue or launch commercially, you need a commercial license.

### Q: Can I use Newton in my YouTube tutorial?

**A:** Yes, if your channel is not monetized. If you have ads, sponsorships, or Patreon, you need a commercial license.

### Q: I work at a company but want to learn Newton on my own time.

**A:** Personal learning is free. If your company later wants to use what you built, they need a commercial license.

### Q: We're a non-profit but charge fees for some programs.

**A:** If those programs generate revenue (even if reinvested), those specific uses require a commercial license.

### Q: Can I fork Newton and make it fully open source?

**A:** No. Forking without permission to relicense is not allowed. You can contribute to the main project instead.

### Q: My open source project receives donations or sponsorships. Do I need a commercial license?

**A:** If donations are voluntary and go to infrastructure/hosting costs only, the free license applies. If sponsorships involve deliverables, paid features, or revenue exceeds $1,000/month, you need a commercial license.

### Q: I'm a researcher at a for-profit company. Can I use the free license?

**A:** No. Research conducted at or funded by for-profit companies requires a commercial license. The free research license is for academic institutions and independent researchers only.

### Q: I'm a student doing freelance work. Which license applies?

**A:** Freelance work is commercial activity. You need a commercial license for any paid work, regardless of your student status. Your coursework and personal learning remain free.

### Q: What if I'm not sure about my use case?

**A:** When in doubt, open a GitHub Issue and ask. We're happy to clarify.
