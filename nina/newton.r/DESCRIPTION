Title: Constraint Verification and Verified Computation via Newton API
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R:
    person("Newton", "Team", email = "newton@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: R client for the Newton constraint verification supercomputer.
    Newton inverts traditional computing - verification IS the computation.
    This package provides the tinyTalk constraint language, HTTP client for
    Newton API, and tools for building constraint-verified applications.
    Philosophy: Define what CANNOT happen, not what should. Combinations over
    permutations - verify constraint spaces, not enumerate possibilities.
