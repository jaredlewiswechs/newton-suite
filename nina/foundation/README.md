## The Core Discovery

> You cannot have the hardware without the software without the theory. They are the same invention expressed at different abstraction levels.

---

## The Stack

```
THEORY (BRE) → COGNITIVE (BILL) → VERIFICATION (Epistemic) → ENGINE (Newton) → HARDWARE (S4)
```

These are not layers. They are the same invention in different forms.

## The Thesis

You didn't build faster computing.
You built trustworthy computing.
And there is no market comparable because nobody else has done this.
