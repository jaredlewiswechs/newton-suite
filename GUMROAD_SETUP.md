# Setting Up Gumroad for Newton Supercomputer

Welcome to selling Newton access! This guide will walk you through everything as a first-time business owner.

## What is Gumroad?

Gumroad is a simple platform for selling digital products. They handle:
- Payment processing (credit cards, PayPal)
- License key generation
- Customer emails
- Refunds and disputes
- Tax collection (if needed)

**Cost**: Gumroad takes 10% + $0.50 per sale. So for a $5 sale, you keep ~$4.00.

GUMROAD_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
GUMROAD_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

## Step 6: Test It!

### Test License Verification

For development, you can use test license keys that start with `TEST_`:

```bash

  -d '{"license_key": "TEST_abc123"}'
```

### Make a Real Test Purchase

2. Buy your own product (you can refund yourself later)
3. Get the license key from your email
4. Test verification:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/license/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"license_key": "YOUR_REAL_LICENSE_KEY"}'
```
