## Who I Am

I built Newton—a verification-first computing system that synthesizes 60 years of constraint programming research into a working API. I taught myself to code while teaching high school. I shipped a production system running at 2.31ms latency while pursuing a Master's degree. I understand both how humans learn and how machines verify.

**The constraint IS the instruction. 1 == 1.**

## What I Built

### **Newton Supercomputer** — Founder & Architect
**Ada Computing Company · Houston, TX · 2025–Present**

Built a Cryptographically Verified Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) system from first principles.

**Technical Achievement:**
- Designed constraint verification engine: **2.31ms median latency** (638x faster than Stripe API, 563x faster than GPT-4)
- Implemented **f/g ratio constraints**—dimensional analysis for computation (finfr = f/g)
- Built immutable audit ledger with **Merkle proof export** for cryptographic verification
- Created **reversible state machine** with bijective operations (try/untry, split/join, lock/unlock)
- Developed **Cohen-Sutherland constraint clipping**—partial execution of valid request portions
- Shipped **115 API endpoints** across 15 namespaces with auto-discovering SDK

**Research Synthesis:**
- Sketchpad (Sutherland, 1963) → constraint relaxation
- Waltz Algorithm (MIT, 1975) → arc consistency pruning
- ThingLab (Borning, Xerox PARC, 1979) → multi-way constraints
- Propagator Networks (Steele & Sussman, 1980) → autonomous cells
- CLP(X) (Jaffar & Lassez, 1987) → formal constraint logic
- Morphic (Ungar & Maloney, 1990s) → direct manipulation of verified objects

**Stack:** Python, FastAPI, SHA-256/Merkle trees, AES-256-GCM, PBFT consensus

### **Teacher's Aide** — Creator & Lead Developer
**Live at:** newton-teachers-aide.pages.dev · **2025–Present**

Built verified education technology used in Houston ISD classrooms.

- **TEKS-aligned lesson planning**: 188 K-8 standards loaded, verified before generation
- **Auto-differentiation engine**: Enter scores → automatic Tier 3/2/1/Enrichment grouping
- **Constraint-verified curriculum**: Lessons are exactly 50 minutes—not "about," exactly
- **PLC report generation**: Data-driven, auditable, exportable

**Impact:** First system where lesson plans are mathematically verified before delivery.

### **tinyTalk DSL** — Language Designer
**Constraint Definition Language for Newton · 2025–Present**

Designed a domain-specific language for expressing constraints as laws:

```python
@law
def no_overdraft(self):
    when(self.withdrawal > self.balance, finfr)
```

- Declarative constraint syntax with `@law` and `@forge` decorators
- Ratio-based constraints using dimensional analysis
- "No-First" philosophy: define what CANNOT happen; valid states derive automatically

---

### **Newton SDK** — Developer
**Auto-Discovering Python Client · 2025–Present**

- Single file, ~500 lines, only dependency: `requests`
- Auto-discovers all 115 endpoints from OpenAPI schema
- 15 namespaces generated dynamically at runtime
- Used in production by Teacher's Aide and research integrations

## What I'm Looking For

A role where I can combine:
- **Human-Computer Interaction research** — I understand how humans learn and how interfaces should work
- **Systems architecture** — I built a verification engine from first principles
- **Education technology** — I've taught in classrooms and built tools that work
- **Formal methods / verification** — I believe computation should be proven, not hoped

I want to work on problems where **correctness matters**. Where the answer isn't "probably right" but **verified**.
