# Lesson 04: Cybersecurity Fundamentals

**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Strong passwords, authentication, and risk mitigation.

## TEKS Alignment (Principles of Information Technology 130.272)
- **(c)(6)(A)** explain common cybersecurity threats.
- **(c)(6)(B)** evaluate password strength and authentication.
- **(c)(6)(C)** demonstrate safe practices for protecting data.

## Objectives
Students will:
1. Identify weak vs. strong passwords.
2. Write a password checklist in realTinyTalk.
3. Explain how MFA reduces risk.

## Materials
- `docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/04_cybersecurity.tt`

## Lesson Flow
### Warm-Up (5 minutes)
- “What makes a password weak?”

### Mini-Lesson (10 minutes)
- Discuss phishing, credential stuffing, and MFA.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Review `04_cybersecurity.tt` and its checklist rules.

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)
- Add a rule (e.g., “no common words”) and test it.

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- “Name one action to protect your account besides a password.”

## realTinyTalk Activity
Run the program:

```bash
python -m realTinyTalk run docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/04_cybersecurity.tt
```

## Differentiation
- **Support:** Provide example passwords to test.
- **Extension:** Add a score that ranks password strength.
