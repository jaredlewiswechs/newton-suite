# Lesson 05: Networking & the Web

**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Networks, protocols, and client/server roles.

## TEKS Alignment (Principles of Information Technology 130.272)
- **(c)(7)(A)** describe how networks exchange data.
- **(c)(7)(B)** identify roles of client/server and protocols.

## Objectives
Students will:
1. Identify common network devices and protocols.
2. Explain how data moves from client to server.
3. Simulate a request log in realTinyTalk.

## Materials
- `docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/05_networking.tt`

## Lesson Flow
### Warm-Up (5 minutes)
- “Name one app that uses the internet.”

### Mini-Lesson (10 minutes)
- Discuss IP, DNS, HTTP, and packets.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Run `05_networking.tt` and inspect the request summary.

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)
- Add a new request and re-calc the summary.

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- “What is one job the DNS system performs?”

## realTinyTalk Activity
Run the program:

```bash
python -m realTinyTalk run docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/05_networking.tt
```

## Differentiation
- **Support:** Provide a diagram of client/server flow.
- **Extension:** Add a filter for failed requests.
