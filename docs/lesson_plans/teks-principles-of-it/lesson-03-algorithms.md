# Lesson 03: Algorithms & Programming

**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Inputs, outputs, sequencing, and functions.

## TEKS Alignment (Principles of Information Technology 130.272)
- **(c)(5)(A)** design algorithms using sequencing and selection.
- **(c)(5)(B)** implement algorithms in a programming language.
- **(c)(5)(C)** test and debug code.

## Objectives
Students will:
1. Define an algorithm and trace its steps.
2. Write a function that applies a rule.
3. Test and debug with sample input.

## Materials
- `docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/03_algorithms.tt`

## Lesson Flow
### Warm-Up (5 minutes)
- “Write instructions for making a peanut butter sandwich.”

### Mini-Lesson (10 minutes)
- Connect everyday routines to algorithms.
- Show a step chain in realTinyTalk.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Run `03_algorithms.tt` and inspect the sorting/filtering steps.

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)
- Modify the function to include a new condition.

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- “What is one test case you used to verify your function?”

## realTinyTalk Activity
Run the program:

```bash
python -m realTinyTalk run docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/03_algorithms.tt
```

## Differentiation
- **Support:** Provide sample inputs.
- **Extension:** Add a second function to compute a score.
