# Lesson 01: Digital Citizenship & Ethics

**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Responsible technology use, digital footprints, and ethical decision-making.

## TEKS Alignment (Principles of Information Technology 130.272)
- **(c)(1)(A)** describe ethical and legal behavior when using digital tools.
- **(c)(1)(B)** identify responsible digital communication and collaboration.
- **(c)(2)(A)** evaluate digital footprints and privacy risks.

## Objectives
Students will:
1. Explain how digital actions create long-term footprints.
2. Identify ethical choices in common tech scenarios.
3. Modify a tiny program to model responsible data handling.

## Materials
- `docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/01_digital_citizenship.tt`
- Projector or IDE for code walkthrough.

## Lesson Flow
### Warm-Up (5 minutes)
- Prompt: “What is one piece of data you should never post online?”

### Mini-Lesson (10 minutes)
- Discuss terms: *digital footprint*, *PII*, *consent*.
- Show how code can model decisions about data sharing.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Walk through `01_digital_citizenship.tt` and identify the **privacy checklist**.
- Students predict output before running.

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)
- Students add one more rule to the checklist (e.g., “Ask for consent before sharing photos.”)

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- “Name two pieces of data you should redact before sharing a file.”

## realTinyTalk Activity
Run the program:

```bash
python -m realTinyTalk run docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/01_digital_citizenship.tt
```

## Differentiation
- **Support:** Provide a list of privacy rules to choose from.
- **Extension:** Ask students to map rules to real-world app settings.
