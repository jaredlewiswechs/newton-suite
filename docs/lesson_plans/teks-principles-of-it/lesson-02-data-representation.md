# Lesson 02: Data Representation & Storage

**Time:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Bits/bytes, encoding, and data validation.

## TEKS Alignment (Principles of Information Technology 130.272)
- **(c)(4)(A)** describe data representation in computing systems.
- **(c)(4)(B)** evaluate how data types impact storage and processing.

## Objectives
Students will:
1. Explain how data is stored in binary.
2. Compare text vs. numeric data types.
3. Use realTinyTalk to validate and label data.

## Materials
- `docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/02_data_representation.tt`

## Lesson Flow
### Warm-Up (5 minutes)
- “If you store a name and an age, what types do you need?”

### Mini-Lesson (10 minutes)
- Define *bit*, *byte*, *encoding*, *data type*.
- Discuss why type conversions matter.

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Walk through `02_data_representation.tt`.
- Identify when `.type`, `.num`, and `.str` are used.

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)
- Add another record to the dataset and re-run the summary.

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- “Why might text need to be converted to a number?”

## realTinyTalk Activity
Run the program:

```bash
python -m realTinyTalk run docs/lesson_plans/teks-principles-of-it/02_data_representation.tt
```

## Differentiation
- **Support:** Provide starter values.
- **Extension:** Have students calculate the average age.
