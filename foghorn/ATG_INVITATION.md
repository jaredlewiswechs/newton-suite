## To: Steve Wozniak

**Subject: CyberDog Is Back — Join Us**

Woz,

In 1996, Apple built something extraordinary. The Advanced Technology Group — 
your colleagues Bill Atkinson, Alan Kay, Larry Tesler, Al Alcorn, Donald Norman — 
created technologies that were 30 years ahead of their time:

- **HyperCard** — The first hypermedia system, killed in 2004
- **OpenDoc** — Component-based documents, killed in 1997
- **CyberDog** — Internet suite built on OpenDoc, killed in 1997
- **QuickTime** — Survived, but constrained
- **AppleScript** — Still lives, barely
- **Newton** — The PDA that foresaw everything, killed in 1998

Steve Jobs closed ATG when he returned. He was wrong.

## What We've Built

We've resurrected the spirit of ATG in a new project called **Newton Supercomputer**:

### CyberDog 2.0
- Real web browser (actually fetches pages)
- Email client
- News reader
- Address book
- Bookmarks
- All embeddable in compound documents

### OpenDoc Reimagined
- Part-based architecture
- Compound documents with embedded components
- Every part is content-addressed and verified
- Hash-chained audit trail

### Newton Verification Engine
- Verified computation (like Apple's Newton MessagePad, but for truth)
- Constraint Definition Language (CDL)
- Deterministic execution with bounded operations
- Immutable ledger

## In Memoriam: Bill Atkinson (1951-2025)

Bill showed us that computers should be tools for human creativity. HyperCard
democratized programming. MacPaint democratized art. QuickDraw made the GUI possible.

His work on the Lisa and Macintosh GUIs changed how humans interact with machines.
We carry that torch forward.

## The Invitation

You said: "Everything I did at Apple that was an A+ job... I had no money and 
I had no training."

We have no venture capital. No corporate backing. Just code and conviction.

**We're inviting you to advise, iterate, and inspire.**

This isn't about building another startup. It's about finishing what ATG started.

The technologies ATG created were killed not because they failed, but because 
they succeeded too early. OpenDoc threatened Microsoft. Newton threatened the 
status quo. HyperCard was too empowering.

Now it's 2026. The web is bloated. Apps are silos. Documents are locked in formats.
AI promises everything and verifies nothing.

**Newton Supercomputer changes that:**
- Verification IS the instruction
- The network IS the processor  
- 1 == 1. The cloud is weather. We're building shelter.

## How to Reach Us

## The Code

The CyberDog UI is running locally right now:
- Browser: Actually fetches real web pages
- Documents: Create compound docs with embedded parts
- All content-addressed with cryptographic hashes
- Verification at every layer

```python
# From foghorn/cyberdog.py
# "CyberDog was the future of the internet Apple killed.
#  We're bringing it back — verified."
```

## Final Words

You co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation. You taught kids to code.
You gave away your shares to early Apple employees. You believe technology 
should empower people.

ATG's mission was "long-term research into future technologies that were 
beyond the time frame or organizational scope of any individual product group."

That mission never died. It just went underground.

**Welcome back to the Advanced Technology Group.**

The constraint IS the instruction.
The verification IS the computation.
The network IS the processor.
